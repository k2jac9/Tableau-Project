# Final-Project-Tableau

## Project/Goals

This project aims to analyze the "Causes of Death - Our World In Data" dataset using Tableau to uncover global patterns in mortality. The goals include identifying major causes of death worldwide, creating insightful visualizations to depict these trends geographically, and developing an interactive dashboard that provides a comprehensive view of global health trends. The project seeks to contribute valuable insights for public health policy and awareness.

## Process

### Step 1: Data Acquisition and Loading
- The dataset was downloaded from Kaggle and imported into Tableau.

### Step 2: Data Exploration and Type Detection
- Initial exploration in Tableau was conducted to understand the dataset's structure and data types.

### Step 3: Data Visualization
- Geographical maps were created to visualize death causes by region.
- Showcased trends over time.
- Different Tableau's analytical tools were used .

### Step 4: Feature Importance Analysis
- Key features in the dataset were analyzed to determine significant causes of death.
- Data-driven questions were formulated based on this analysis.

### Step 5: Pattern Detection
- The dataset was explored to find unique patterns, trends, and outliers.

### Step 6: Dashboard Development
- A comprehensive dashboard was developed in Tableau, aimed at answering the formulated questions.

## Results
- A map visualization was created, showing deaths per capita and various causes of death, highlighting the geographical distribution and prevalence of different causes.
- The project focused on identifying and analyzing primary causes of death globally and their variations across countries.

## Challenges
- Connecting to different databases and accurately mapping countries posed significant challenges.
- Ensuring data consistency and accuracy was a critical aspect of the project.

## Future Goals
- Expand the project by creating additional dashboards with deeper analyses.
- Integrate more data sources for a holistic view of global health trends.
- Enhance the dashboard with more interactive features to improve user engagement and insight extraction.
- Use more advanced tools with for forecasting forecasting.
